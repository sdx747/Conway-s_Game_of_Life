Conway's Game of Life follows three rules:

1.  Any alive cell with two or three alive neighbours survives.

2.  Any dead cell with three alive neighbours becomes an alive
     cell.

3.  All other alive cells die in the next generation.
     Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

In this game, Black cells are dead, Yellow cells are alive.

Click on any cell to change it's state from dead to alive and vice versa, or click the 'RANDOM' button to generate a random sequence of cells.

Click the 'START' button to start the simulation and enjoy the show.

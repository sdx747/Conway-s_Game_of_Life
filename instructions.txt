Conway's Game of Life follows three rules:

1.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.

2.  Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes an live
     cell.

3.  All other live cells die in the next generation.
     Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

In this game, Black cells are dead, Yellow cells are live.

Click on any cell to change it's state from dead to live and vice versa, or click the 'RANDOM' button to generate a random sequence of cells.

Click the 'START' button to start the simulation and enjoy the show.
